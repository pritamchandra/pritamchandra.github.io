      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is not a wise thing to do to test scripture to align with the scientific narrative of creation, especially in terms of chronology of creation. This is not because they contradict, but simply because Scripture has metaphysical elements which science cannot take into account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, time as we know it is demarcated by the objects in the space (heavenly bodies) and forces applied by them. These themselves are created in the third day of the Genesis narrative. So, what day 1 represents is not our familiar physical time (which was only created in day 3). Neither the order of the days represents the chronology of creation.&#xA;Rather, the creation narrative should be seen from God&amp;rsquo;s perspective, which is outside time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
