      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a strange thing that all these years have passed. The nervousness is intact. I have a vague memory of telling people that I wished to work part time as a construction laborer. This was when I had a big job. Though I lied a lot then, this was true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays I write ledgers in my village. There is dust everywhere and a stench in the bathroom. But it&amp;rsquo;s fine. I hang out only with the villagers. And I don&amp;rsquo;t lust after women.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Piu in the Cavea</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sitting at edge of the enormous cavea, I am facing its long flow down into the empty amphitheater. A swarm of young men and woman are aggressively dancing in the bars behind me to the beat of erotic music. Saturday nights here are loud and crowded. So it is quite unusual to see eight year old Piu jump down the empty flight of high stairs stretching&#xA;before me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know Piu at all. In her appearance she resembles my childhood friend with the same name. And hence I call her that too. For Piu the journey down is not yet comfortable. Every new jump she makes is just like her first one. Carefully thought and then acted out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unprepared</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At this moment I am not on a flight. Not traveling by a car on an edgy hill-way. At this moment I am just lying on my bed. This is peaceful. This is not a chaotic border. Not  the middle of the ocean. This is just a peaceful place. This kind of peaceful makes a tomorrow certain. That no matter what happens there&amp;rsquo;s surely a morning on the other side of a few hours. So, at this moment I lie back with patience. I think about a life eventually falling in place. I see the hazy flashes from the times to come. My parents have come to hugging each other again. That book? Yeah I&amp;rsquo;ve recently published it. Oh, the new car doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a hood. And she insists on wearing that little ring I gave her in school. So I build hopes at this moment. This moment that I have taken for granted. As if future is so obvious, and continuity - so inevitable. As if such chances like a one in a million aren&amp;rsquo;t chances at all. As if every moment ever is just like this moment. Only better ahead, and worse left behind. And then I realize, I have never been so unprepared to die as I am at this moment. That if I am taken by surprise and told of a giant meteor that hits the planet in five minutes, I would wake with a jolt, go restless, and get lost at all that was left to happen, and all that I would miss. I would try, and cry, and crave, and spend my last five minutes as the worst five ones. I am so unprepared that if I know that it ends at this moment, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to take a walk, I would run.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He was the other guy. No, not the one who was exchanging stares with the girl. He was sitting at the other table. He was quite glad seeing their little tale unfold in just gazes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He wasn&amp;rsquo;t the one who put the ball through the hoop. He was just there by the court. Everybody cried the shooter&amp;rsquo;s name in unison.  And he joined them too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was never the one  who took walks in the fog. But he did listen when someone narrated conversations they had during those walks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
