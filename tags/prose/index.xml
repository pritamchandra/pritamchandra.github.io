      <description>&lt;p&gt;He was the other guy. No, not the one who was exchanging stares with the girl. He was sitting at the other table. He was quite glad seeing their little tale unfold in just gazes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He wasn&amp;rsquo;t the one who put the ball through the hoop. He was just there by the court. Everybody cried the shooter&amp;rsquo;s name in unison.  And he joined them too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was never the one  who took walks in the fog. But he did listen when someone narrated conversations they had during those walks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
