      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wish he rather went to You when he saw her down the lane. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;If only had he known You then. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Did the child know he didn&amp;rsquo;t have to be loud? &lt;br&gt;&#xA;He didn&amp;rsquo;t need the little mores, but did he still push through the crowd? &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Was it there he began running? &lt;br&gt;&#xA;It was probably not late. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;But I don&amp;rsquo;t know if he has ever stopped yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wish he rather went to You when he stretched before those men. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;If only had he known You then. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Did the child tremble guarding his mother like a shield? &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Did he not know there was no might that he could yield? &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Was it there he began trying? &lt;br&gt;&#xA;It was probably not late. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;But I don&amp;rsquo;t know if he has ever stopped yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Anthropic Principle</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a strange thing that all these years have passed. The nervousness is intact. I have a vague memory of telling people that I wished to work part time as a construction laborer. This was when I had a big job. Though I lied a lot then, this was true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays I write ledgers in my village. There is dust everywhere and a stench in the bathroom. But it&amp;rsquo;s fine. I hang out only with the villagers. And I don&amp;rsquo;t lust after women.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Piu in the Cavea</title>
      <link>https://pritamchandra.github.io/post/2022/12/14/piu-in-the-cavea/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sitting at edge of the enormous cavea, I am facing its long flow down into the empty amphitheater. A swarm of young men and woman are aggressively dancing in the bars behind me to the beat of erotic music. Saturday nights here are loud and crowded. So it is quite unusual to see eight year old Piu jump down the empty flight of high stairs stretching&#xA;before me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know Piu at all. In her appearance she resembles my childhood friend with the same name. And hence I call her that too. For Piu the journey down is not yet comfortable. Every new jump she makes is just like her first one. Carefully thought and then acted out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Way by the Cliff</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Way by the cliff where walk all the men, &lt;br&gt;&#xA;the Way so true keeps the cliff hidden. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Some odds yet turn to the cliff running by - &lt;br&gt;&#xA;the deep dark cliff where no good lie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plain men pass, they walk just free. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;The odds unlike, they can&amp;rsquo;t unsee &lt;br&gt;&#xA;the brink of the cliff, they mourn&amp;rsquo;n despair, &lt;br&gt;&#xA;can&amp;rsquo;t deny the cliff so clearly there!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For long on the cliff so their sharp eyes set, &lt;br&gt;&#xA;still stand on the way, their heads forget.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unprepared</title>
      <link>https://pritamchandra.github.io/post/2020/06/14/unprepared/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At this moment I am not on a flight. Not traveling by a car on an edgy hill-way. At this moment I am just lying on my bed. This is peaceful. This is not a chaotic border. Not  the middle of the ocean. This is just a peaceful place. This kind of peaceful makes a tomorrow certain. That no matter what happens there&amp;rsquo;s surely a morning on the other side of a few hours. So, at this moment I lie back with patience. I think about a life eventually falling in place. I see the hazy flashes from the times to come. My parents have come to hugging each other again. That book? Yeah I&amp;rsquo;ve recently published it. Oh, the new car doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a hood. And she insists on wearing that little ring I gave her in school. So I build hopes at this moment. This moment that I have taken for granted. As if future is so obvious, and continuity - so inevitable. As if such chances like a one in a million aren&amp;rsquo;t chances at all. As if every moment ever is just like this moment. Only better ahead, and worse left behind. And then I realize, I have never been so unprepared to die as I am at this moment. That if I am taken by surprise and told of a giant meteor that hits the planet in five minutes, I would wake with a jolt, go restless, and get lost at all that was left to happen, and all that I would miss. I would try, and cry, and crave, and spend my last five minutes as the worst five ones. I am so unprepared that if I know that it ends at this moment, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to take a walk, I would run.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Friend of the Hero</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He was the other guy. No, not the one who was exchanging stares with the girl. He was sitting at the other table. He was quite glad seeing their little tale unfold in just gazes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He wasn&amp;rsquo;t the one who put the ball through the hoop. He was just there by the court. Everybody cried the shooter&amp;rsquo;s name in unison.  And he joined them too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was never the one  who took walks in the fog. But he did listen when someone narrated conversations they had during those walks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
